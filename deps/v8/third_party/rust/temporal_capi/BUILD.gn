# v8 depends on temporal_capi, which may occasionally update in ways that
# change its API. Since temporal_capi lives in the chromium repo, v8 cannot
# be atomically upgraded alongside temporal_capi changes. Instead, we have some
# `defines` here that let v8 detect which version of temporal_capi is vendored.
#
# In case we are vendoring multiple versions of temporal_capi, it is acceptable
# to have multiple `defines`.
#
# It is not mandatory to update the `defines` list every time temporal_capi
# updates; it is just a convenient tool to use as needed.

# v8 includes headers and targets from paths that include a specific crate
# epoch in a directory name (e.g. `v0_0_8`).  To insulate v8 from the exact
# paths:
#
# * We have some indirection via `group` / `public_deps` to forward to the
#   right target
# * We set `include_dirs` by depending on the right config via `public_configs`
#
# We also opportunistically have a public dependency on the `defines` `config` above.
